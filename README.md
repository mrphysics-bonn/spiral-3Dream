# Spiral 3DREAM

This repository contains Pulseq sequence files and reconstructed images from the paper "Spiral 3DREAM sequence for fast whole-brain B1 Mapping".

The "seq" folder holds Pulseq sequence files of the spiral 3DREAM sequence for 2/3/4/5 mm isotropic resolution.
The "images" folder holds spiral & Cartesian 3DREAM images including FA maps, FID (filtered/not filtered) and STE images. Additionally FA maps from an AFI sequence are available.

The reconstruction pipeline can be found at https://github.com/mrphysics-bonn/python-ismrmrd-reco. Contact the author for more information on the pipeline.
