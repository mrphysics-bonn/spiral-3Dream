# spiral-3Dream

## Code for bachelor thesis on expanding the 3DREAM sequence for B1 mapping with a spiral imaging train

The repository includes notebooks for the spiral 2DREAM and 3DREAM implementation using Pulseq [1] (with Python's toolbox PyPulseq [2])
and extra code for analysis that is done in the bachelor thesis.

The name of each notebook arises from the belonging figure number in the thesis.
